  `Hey all, I’m Deckard! I’ve been a part of the Furry Fandom since 2013. I’m an audio engineer currently based out of Denver with several years experience working on projects ranging from short films and live performances to music production and game audio. I am formally trained as a post production sound engineer with expertise in film audio recording, editing and mixing in several formats.`,
  `I started AudioElk because I’ve always felt that there has been a lack of attention given to the audio side of the fandom, and I want to partner up with artists, videographers, and developers to create more audio content for the fandom! Whether it’s short animations, con videos, furry games, or whatever else you can imagine, I want to be a part of it!`,
